# handy-homepage

This tool helps prepare an organized link list in a single HTML page that can be set as the browser's default homepage.

The main idea sparkles when I saw a simple version on my colleague, Ryan Antkowiak's, browser home page.

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```

```

### How to use:
* Modify the JSON file in `src/data.json`. Make sure you keep the JSON data format as is.

* Open the file `dist/index.html` in the browser.

### Configurations:
After installation, modify the `.env` file for configurations
